# Notes
- I wish that data types had to be defined like in Java or Coral
- lists == arrays
- Inserting an element at a given index puts the element at that index, and then pushes all the other element's indecies at that given index and forward forward
- Slicing:
  - [0:4] starts at starting index, ends BEFORE ending index
  - [4:] 4 until end
  - [posMarker:posMarker+3] starts at `posMarker`, ends BEFORE 3 more than `posMarker`
